        <h1>A Somewhat Different New Year</h1>
        This is probably not the best children's book but hey open sourced on Github and maybe you could learn something about Asian life, technology & little theology through this somewhat different documentation merging together
        
        Mei and Thanh spend a somewhat different New Year! From Asian grandpa wisdom to drone fireworks, this book imparts colorful knowledge while speaking a deep language of love that can only be found in the living room of a family party. A warm invitation to enter and join in!

        <h2>üôèüèΩ A Somewhat Different Background</h2>
        
        <p>üê≤</p>
        <p></p>This year my Vietnamese auntie gifted me a food package with 10 different self-cooked dishes carefully wrapped and express delivered all the way from the south of Germany yay!</p>
        <p>Around the corner on a computer the size of a fridge, <a href="https://www.informatik.kit.edu/downloads/zu-30JahreInternet-EMail-V01-28Jul2014.pdf">Germany's first email</a> over the expanded ARPANET'S CSNET was received from the US and Prof Zorn further helped to set up the Beijing node thereby also receiving <a href="https://www.informatik.kit.edu/downloads/HQarticle-08Feb2014-final-version-engl.pdf">China's first email</a> that read &quot;Across the Great Wall we can reach every corner in the world&quot;.</p>
        <p>According to the professor it was being labeled <a href="https://www.kit.edu/kit/pi_2014_15510.php">exotic science</a> back in the 80s and deffo I was exotic studying at this wannabe mit aka karlsruhe institute of technology later.</p>
        <p>Being a 2nd-gen refugee female of color in tech can hurt e.g. with a CS male-female ratio of <a href="https://www.kit.edu/downloads/Statistik_WS2016.pdf">91:9</a> when I started but you really care about your parents, auntie, uncle &amp; co being yelled at, made fun of, or insulted for the way we look and speak.</p>
        <p>‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π</p>
        <p>There's so much love in the nature of bowing, family bonding, and celebrating universal vs individual birthday on lunar new year.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-CJB-20534">Baidu has been visualizing</a> the largest annual human migration based on smartphone data analogue google live maps since 2014 and tencent reported <a href="https://internetretailing.net/wechat-sees-23-boom-during-chinese-new-year-as-consumers-and-brands-embrace-super-app/">4bn red envelopes</a> having been sent through wechat last year.</p>
        <p>I'm blessed I could always sneak dinner at my auntie's during my studies and now unbox the new year's package together on video through viber, an Israeli-founded-rakuten-acquired messenger used by Vietnamese, email remaining one in few open communication standards.</p>
        <p>I really loved a zoo story for children on <a href="https://quran.com/en/an-nur/45">Surah An-Nur 24:45</a>: &quot;And Allah has created from water every living creature. Some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.&quot;</p>
        <p>üêß</p>
        <p>God has created such a wonderful world. Creating, documenting &amp; open sourcing this children's book &quot;A Somewhat Different New Year&quot; in this now world wide web carries the hope to reach through walls of narrow eyes even if in the littlest way and celebrate a new age coming.</p>

        <h2>ü™ê A Somewhat Different Product Process</h2>
        
        <p><img src="https://powerful.kim/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/githubloveb.jpg" style="width: 40%;"/></p>
        <p>How amazing is GitHub's video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc">&quot;Let's build from here&quot;</a> (btw the CEO is German) üê•!</p>
        <p>Maybe the only person seriously interested in the book was Tom Nick bc he wanted to create his own. But hey a google dev with cool projects like <a href="https://pokemoncries.com/">pokemoncries</a> asking about it, maybe &quot;version controlling&quot; here isn't all too inadequate.</p>
        <p><strong>Marvellous Manyu</strong> üñ§ took care of all formalities like ISBN as well as the Chinese perspective. We met sitting across each other during our amzn internship, so close I still spammed her over night 5y later &quot;I have a sudden idea...&quot; to find her simply reply next morning &quot;Oki let's do it!&quot;.</p>
        <p><strong>Super Huyen</strong> üë©üèº‚ÄçüöÄ is our illustrator in Saigon wondrously connected through Upwork and working together <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/guide/">GitLab's all-remote</a> style. The young Vietnamese creative economy is super inspiring to see develop and it's been a gift to bond through all &quot;#plsfix&quot; and to this day!</p>
        <p>Biased to <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08GKYJVL1">work backwards</a>, in the beginning we alr imagined the book reaching through an amzn detail page, Asian supermarket chains, local Asian restaurants, network effects through boundary-spanning friends, doing guerilla stuff like just putting it randomly into a bookstore shelf, or the like.</p>
        <p>None of this ever happened but it went...</p>

        <h4>üõπ v0  Inspiration (Nov19-)</h4>
        <p><img src="https://powerful.kim/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/v1.jpg" style="width: 300px;"/></p>
        <p>There are so many amazing new children's books not drawn with the classic &quot;skin color&quot; pencil, teachers happy about having &quot;united nations&quot; in their classrooms, last time I checked I really liked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1445166909">&quot;Black History Matters&quot;</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1638070628/">&quot;Native American Stories for Kids&quot;</a>.</p>
        <p>The first graphic novel I picked up as an adult was my brother-Bill Gates-recommended &quot;The Best We Could Do&quot; which astonished me that someone non-Asian could be interested in our background. Thi Bui later also released a children's book A Different Pond which was the first children's book Of thee I singBarack Obama</p>


        
        <h4>üõ¥ v1 Production (Oct20-)</h4>
        <p><img src="https://powerful.kim/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/v2b.jpg" style="width: 300px;"/></p>
        <p>So much about artifact-based communication, we even mocked up the ISBN barcode :-) In this phase we set the composition, story, illustrations, researched a lot and it was cool to see the ideas literally receive shape and color. We researched, had in-depth &quot;interviews&quot; with the elder</p>
        <p>we also rejoiced all the cute &amp; new children's book and learning more about traditions from our elder, collecting all the details that should be part of it: e.g. sliced fruit, a monkey, secret Christian elements :D, no-non-Christian-elements, jade armband, hugging pillow, (like a different pond/ the best we could do), scissors, duck egg, dog, barefoot, forced calls, drone fireworks, digital red envelopes, bowing</p>

        <p><img src="https://powerful.kim/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/v3.jpg" style="width: 300px;"/></p>
        <p>first &quot;fake door&quot; print, personal &quot;press releases&quot;, book release party (wonder doesn't even exist anymore), first real order</p>
